# Hypothesis testing again

Congratulations on completing the previous task and on writing your first program to perform a hypothesis test. To be clear, the workflow in hypothesis testing is illustrated in the flowchart below:

![](hypo-testing.001.jpg)

To complete this task you must use the workflow illustrated in the flow chart above to test whether I am lying by telling you that the file `mydata.dat` here contains two hundred samples from a normal random variable with expectation 4 and variance 9.  Your null hypothesis for the test here will be that the data points are from a normal random variable with expectation 4 and variance 9.  The alternative hypothesis will then be that data points are not samples from this distribution.  You must write code to determine the __statistic__ and the __critical region__ for a 5% significance level.  I have set up the functions as they were in the previous exercise to get you started with this task so follow the instructions from the previous exercise when setting them up. 

Based on the test you perform you then need to print whether the null hypothesis is rejected or if the evidence does not support the rejection of the null hypothesis.  Notice that the language you use here is important and the tests will fail if you do not use the correct phraseology.
